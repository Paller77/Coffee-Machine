# Coffee-Machine
This little code creates a Coffee Machine UI in the console written via Python.
  - You can choose from 3 different drinks (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino). Each drink has a unique price.
  - You of course have to pay for the drink :D Pay by coins. (Quarter, Dime, Nickle, Penny)
  - Tha machine will calculate the refund and will prepare your drink.
  - If the inserted coins are not enough then the transaction will be declined.
  - The machine has a storage of resources which will be less after every transaction. If a resource is not enough then the drink can not be made.
  - Error message will pop up if there are not enough resources.
  - You can enter into Service mode by typing "Service". There you can print a report to check the resources. Type "Unplug" after to disconnect the machine (End the program). The next time it will be filled ;).
  - You can also turn off the screen by typing "Turn off" and "ON"
